# Cloth Simulation Project 🌐

Welcome to the **Cloth Simulation** project! This is a real-time, interactive simulation where you can see and interact with realistic cloth physics. Dive into the amazing world of simulations and experience how fabric behaves in real life through computational modeling. 🤸‍♂️

## Live Demo 🎮

Explore the simulation in action:

- **[CodePen Demo](https://codepen.io/suzan_p/full/ZEPjvNG)** ✨
- **[GitHub Pages - Cloth Simulation](https://sjnprjl.github.io/cloth-simulation/)** 🌍

## Features ⭐

- **Realistic Cloth Behavior**: Watch as cloth moves and reacts to forces like gravity and wind. 🌬️
- **Interactive**: Click and drag to interact with the cloth, and see how it behaves. 🖱️
- **Lightweight**: Built with lightweight and efficient JavaScript to provide smooth performance on various devices. 📱💻

## Technologies Used ⚙️

- **HTML5 & CSS3**: For rendering the simulation interface. 🖥️
- **JavaScript**: Used to create and simulate the cloth behavior. 💻
- **WebGL**: For rendering 2D cloth on a 3D canvas. 🌐

## How It Works 🧠

This simulation uses advanced physics algorithms to calculate and simulate the movement and tension in cloth material. The system computes forces like gravity, collisions, and other dynamic changes, giving users a realistic experience. 🌪️

## How to Use 🛠️

1. **Interact**: Use the mouse or touch controls to click and drag the cloth. 🤚
2. **Adjust Parameters**: Experiment with different settings to modify the cloth's behavior and see how it responds. ⚙️
3. **Explore the Demo**: View the live demo on CodePen or GitHub Pages to see the project in action! 🚀
